Ahmet Salman

On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

1st Week ( 3/02/2020 - 9/02/2020 )
I was introduced to my group members by someone I knew from CS 101, and due to the fact that there were no labs for the first week, we didn't meet as much, so it took about a week for all the members to introduce themselves and develop some form of harmony.

2nd Week ( 10/02/2020 - 16/02/2020 )
In this week, we started brainstorming trying to decide on an idea for the group project, at first we had number of idea, however we later discarded most of them for multiple reasons. So this week ended without us doing anything, unfortunately. But we started to get a better grasp of what we are expected to do.

3rd Week ( 17/02/2020 - 23/02/2020)
At this point in time, we have reached a consensus regarding the project idea, we have decided on a scheduler, so we were waiting for your (Professor David) / the TA's approval on the Idea, however we managed to receive feedback from you before the TA. You gave us a number of things we have to keep in mind and some other issues we have to find a solution to prior to Starting to build the project.


4th Week ( 24/03/2020 - 01/03/2020 )
During this week, we had our idea proposal presentation, this Was a great opportunity to get a direct insight into what You, along with the TAs, think about out project idea, There were a number of problems, some of them being Very integral, such as the lack of clearance for the Students to access the university's database, which Was crucial for the project.

5th Week ( 2/03/2020 - 8/03/2020 )
I, along with my teammates, spent this week brainstorming Other idea, we came up with 2, the one I came up with Was very graphical intensive as well as it wasn't educational For programmers, while one of my friend's ideas was about Making the logging in process to SRS much easier and Convenient, however we faced the same problem as the Previous idea, which is a lack of clearance from BCC.

6th Week ( 9/03/2020 - 15/03/2020 )
At this point, the group met personally with you and you suggested that we work on a code review tool which would be a pretty interesting and hopefully challenging project, so we decided to finalize the Project idea to be that. After the lab we started instantly thinking about the project.

7th Week ( 16/03/2020 - 22/03/2020 )
Springbreak
During this time, I started to build my part Which was the file management aspect of the project I specifically chose this part because, at that time, I had completed my AttendenceExtractor project, and I Gained a fair amount of experience dealing with files, So I thought it would be best if I focus on building the File management system of the review tool

8th Week ( 23/03/2020 - 29/03/2020 )
In this week, the thinking time was over and I had to start actually building it, however we haven't completely distributed all the workloads on all the group members. So, during one of the meetings We decided to split the work load into 3 main parts With every 2 members forming a team and building one Of the cornerstones of the project, as a result, my Friend (Tuna Öğut) ended up helping me in the file management Aspect of the project

9th Week ( 30/03/2020 - 5/04/2020 )
During this week, I learned how to save and create new files in accordance with the requirements of the Project, although I first thought it would be an easy Mater, it turned out to be more challenging than I have first anticipated, especially because I was very new to Exception handling. So at the end of this week I managed to get the Save File and New File to work, I also implemented some safety features to prevent the user from opening an invalid file which would lead the program to crash.

10th Week ( 6/04/2020 - 12/04/2020 )
Now that half of the my part is done, I still have To get the Close File and Open File buttons to work The open file button was relatively easy to deal with, Thanks to Java's already prepared classes, but the close Button was a more complicated matter, because I had to Coordinate everything with my teammate in order to result In a functional end product, at least for our part. Because my friend was developing a file explorer panel which helps the user to change between different files, it wasn't as simple as setting the code display area to an empty string.

11th Week ( 13/04/2020 - 19/04/2020 )
Due to the Math (Calculus) exam that was approaching I wasn't able to progress as much during this week, however I was able to make the Close File functional for the most part, But I was still waiting for my other groupmates to finish a Certain part of the project so I can integrate the closing Mechanism with the rest of their classes. So this week was less productive than I would've hoped for, at least in terms Of the project progress.

12th Week ( 20/04/2020 - 26/04/2020 )
In this week, my friend finished his file explorer part which allowed me to start on the integration of the file Management processes with the file explorer panel, as well As some other parts of the project. This proved to be a little Challenging for myself (Which is good, I enjoyed it!), but I managed to get it to work before the start of the next week

13th Week ( 27/04/2020 - 3/05/2020 )
At this point we are running out of time, we only have 2 weeks left In this semester, so I requested all the features that have been finalized To be committed to GitHub, and I started extending the file management Mechanism into them, it was getting easier, but still challenging  Nonetheless, however now I feel more familiar with how to manipulate Files in Java, and how to make sure everything runs smoothly, during this Week I was able to start saving the comments written in our program, which Was done in a twisted way to some extent, but it works

14th Week ( 2/03/2020 - 8/03/2020 )
