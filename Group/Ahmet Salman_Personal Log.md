On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

1st Week ( 3/02/2020 - 9/02/2020 )
i was introduced to my group members by someone i knew from CS 101,
and due to the fact that there were no labs for the first week, we 
didn't meet as much, so it took about a week for all the members
to introduce themselves and develop some form of harmony.

2nd Week ( 10/02/2020 - 16/02/2020 )
In this week, we started brainstorming trying to decide on an
idea for the group project, at first we had number of idea, however
we later discarded most of them for multiple reasons. So this week
ended without us doing anything, unfortunately. but we started to 
get a better grasp of what we are expected to do.

3rd Week ( 17/02/2020 - 23/02/2020)
At this point in time, we have reached a consensus regarding
the project idea, we have decided on a scheduler, so we were 
waiting for your( Professor David )/the TA's approval on the
idea, however we managed to recieve feedback from you before
the TA. you gave us a number of things we have to keep in mind
and some other issues we have to find a solution to prior to 
starting to build the project

4th Week ( 24/03/2020 - 01/03/2020 )
During this week, we had our idea proposal presentation, this 
was a great oppurtunity to get a direct insight into what 
you, along with the TAs, think about out project idea, 
there were a number of problems, some of them being
very integral, such as the lack of clearence for the
students to access the university's database, which 
was cruscial for the project.
