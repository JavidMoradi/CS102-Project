On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ week #1 ( 3/02/2020 - 9/02/2020 ) ~
First of the semester. I met with some people that I knew from CS101 and I was planning on group members. 

### ~ week #2 ( 10/02/2020 - 16/02/2020 ) ~
Decided on the memebers of the group. All members of the group was thinking about on good project idea. Couldn't come up with particular idea, but we got to know each other.

### ~ week #3 ( 17/02/2020 - 23/02/2020) ~
Decided on the project idea, which was "Course Schedule Planner." Then decided on the presenters of the upcoming week's presentation. I volunteered on the entrance part of the presentation. We, the presenters, gathered up and prepared the powerpoint presentation. 

### ~ week #4 ( 24/03/2020 - 01/03/2020 ) ~
Due to my opininon we managed to make a good presentation, as well as, gave feedback on our scheduler idea. Since the idea was so dependant on the BCC's data and student are prohibited to access those, we ignore the scheduler idea and look forward on the new one. 

### ~ week #5 ( 2/03/2020 - 8/03/2020 ) ~
The brainstorming continued and we came up with a new idea, which was QR code reader that would direct us right into the Bilkent Stars, but we faced with the previous one's problem wiht this one again, which was the prohibition of access to BCC's data.

### ~ week #6 ( 9/03/2020 - 15/03/2020 ) ~
We finally decided to consult Professor Davenport on the project idea. He suggest us code reviewer tool. We thinked about the idea and then decided to continue with this idea.

### ~ week #7 ( 16/03/2020 - 22/03/2020 ) ~
A week break due to spring break and coronavirus outbreak.

### ~ week #8 ( 23/03/2020 - 29/03/2020 ) ~
We designed our project on paper and agreed with that temporary design. Then split up the parts of it among each other. I paired up with Atasagun to do the Home panel's functions.

### ~ week #9 ( 30/03/2020 - 5/04/2020 ) ~
We (me and Atasagun) divided the functions of the panel among each other, however I couldn't progress so much due to workloads from other lectures. I could just make a draft planning for myself.

### ~ week #10 ( 6/04/2020 - 12/04/2020 ) ~
I couldn't concentrate on the prject because of the upcoming calculus midterm.

### ~ week #11 ( 13/04/2020 - 19/04/2020 ) ~
I couldn't make a great progress in this week either due to my calculus and dicrete mathematics exams. However, after end of the exams, I talked with Atasagun about bits and pieces of our part.

### ~ week #12 ( 20/04/2020 - 26/04/2020 ) ~
I managed to provide a change size function, and I was about to provide an auto-indentation button; however, one of the members noticed an contradiction on our design, so me and Atasagun couldn't progress further.

### ~ week #13 ( 27/04/2020 - 3/05/2020 ) ~
Find some good replacements for our remaining part. I updated README layout, as well as, the scheme of the meetings and personal logs.

### ~ week #14 ( 2/05/2020 - 8/05/2020 ) ~
